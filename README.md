# GitHub Starry Night

**GitHub Starry Night** is a stargazing-inspired contribution visualizer built for developers who want to see their coding journey written in the stars — literally.

Forget the grid. This is a full-screen, animated sky where your GitHub activity becomes constellations, golden stars, and drifting planets. It’s calm, beautiful, and entirely based on your real contribution data.

This project was created for a hackathon with one goal:  
**Make contribution tracking feel magical.**

## 🌌 Features

### Real Starry Sky
- Thousands of naturally scattered stars
- Twinkling effects with real star colors (white, blue, red, yellow)
- Occasional shooting stars
- Distant planets with glow and rings
- Deep space gradient that feels like a real night sky

### Visualizing Contributions
- Your top 15 contribution days become highlighted stars
- Top 5 days form your **main constellation**
- Next 4 days form a **secondary triangle constellation**
- Soft lines connect nearby stars into elegant constellation patterns
- Golden stars = your most productive moments

### No More Grids
- Contributions are scattered across the sky — not stuck in a heatmap
- Every user gets a unique visual layout
- Peaceful, organic, and intuitive

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Enter your **GitHub username**
2. The app fetches your public contribution history (handled by the JavaScript logic)
3. Your best days light up the sky with stars and constellations
4. The p5.js sketch draws everything in real time

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the way constellations tell stories — we wanted to do the same with code.
